# Smart Library Management System

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive **Library Management System** developed using Python. It leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Database Management System (DBMS) principles to efficiently manage books and users. The system provides functionalities for adding books, managing users, borrowing and returning books, and viewing the list of books and users.

## Key Features

- **Object-Oriented Design**: Utilizes OOP principles to create a scalable and maintainable system. Key components include `Book`, `User`, and `Admin` classes.
- **Database Integration**: Employs SQLite as the database management system to store and manage book and user data.
- **User Management**: Allows for the addition of users, tracking of borrowed books, and management of user information.
- **Book Management**: Facilitates adding new books, searching for books, and updating book availability.
- **User Interface**: Provides a command-line interface for interacting with the system.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for development.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database management system used for data storage.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Design approach for creating modular and reusable code.
- **Database Management System (DBMS)**: Principles for data storage, retrieval, and management.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash

    ```

3. Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3.6 or higher is recommended).

4. Run the `GUIManager.py.py` file to start the application:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
## Usage

Upon running `GUIManager.py.py`, a command-line menu will be displayed, allowing you to perform various operations:

1. Add a book
2. Print all books
3. Search for books by prefix
4. Add a user
5. Borrow a book
6. Return a book
7. Print users with borrowed books
8. Print all users

Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the system.
